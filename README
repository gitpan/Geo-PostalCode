Geo::Postalcode is a module for calculating the distance between two postal
codes.  It can find the postal codes within a specified distance of another
postal code.  It can lookup the city, state, longitude and latitude by
postal code.

To access the data, it uses Berkeley DB, which is fast and portable
(most Linux/Unix servers have it pre-installed.)

To install, see the INSTALL file.

This class is designed to be easy to subclass.  For example,
Geo::PostalCode::US could contain all US Zipcodes.
