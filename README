Geo::Postalcode is a module for calculating the distance between two postal
codes.  It can find the postal codes within a specified distance of another
postal code.  It can lookup the city, state, longitude and latitude by
postal code.

The data is from the 1999 US Census database of U.S. Postal Codes,
available from http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/zip1999.html.

To access the data, it uses Berkeley DB, which is fast and portable
(most Linux/Unix servers have it pre-installed.)

To install, see the INSTALL file.
