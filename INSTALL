  make
  make test
  make install

This module comes with no postal code data.  You should
download and install your own data.  For example, to download and
install a database of US postal codes (from 2004), you could run:

 lwp-download http://civicspacelabs.org/releases/zipcodes/zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.tgz
 tar zxf zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.tgz
 ./bin/geo_postalcode_makedb ./zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004/zipcode.csv /your/db/path

Then create objects using this database with:

  my $gp = Geo::PostalCode->new(db_dir => '/your/db/path');

The older data-file (from 1999) still works with the module, in case you want to use it.
